# AWS-IAM-EC2-Management

This project demonstrates managing permissions with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). The project covers the following:

- Creation of two EC2 instances tagged as `development` and `production`.
- Development of specific policies to manage actions based on instance tags.
- Setup of a user group and attachment of tailored policies.
- Creation of a user with permissions to start/stop the `development` instance while restricting stopping of the `production` instance.
